# Structure-Formation
Structure formation tutorials using 21cmFAST.  These are intended as hands-on excercises 
that acompany the course Structure formation in the early Universe.  
The course textbook (in prep) is a [PDF here](/course_notes.pdf).

## Current List of Tutorial Notebooks

    1. **Initial Conditions**: Make and visualize initial conditions (density + velocities).  Change seeds. Change cosmology: PS, transfer function cutt-off; non-Gaussianity (maybe?)
    2. **Perturbation Theory**
    3. **Halo Finding**
    4. **Halo Power Spectrum**
    5. **Galaxy Sampling**
    6. **Reionization**
    7. **Lyman alpha emission**
    8. **RSDs and Lightcone Evolution**
    9. **Lya Forest**
    10. **21-cm signal**
    11. **kSZ signal**

## Contributing

The best way to setup to write docs is to install the common environment using

```bash
uv sync
```

To install `uv` see [their documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/),
which generally boils down to:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
